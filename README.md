2. Open command line and install  [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) (version 13 or upper).
3. Decompress nba-players.zip and go to nba-players root folder.
4. Open a command line terminal and type npm install to download all project dependencies.

## Notes

A paginator was added to show the data when the amount of data exceeds 500 elements. This was made because with some values, the amount of data is large and the browser gets lock trying to render the data. When the amount of coincidences is less than 500, paginator isn't shown.
